    ### Why QC-Selector?
    In the world of chemistry, selecting the right subset of molecules is critical for a wide
    range of applications, including drug discovery, materials science, and molecular optimization. 
    QC-Selector offers a cutting-edge solution to streamline this process, empowering researchers, 
    scientists, and developers to make smarter decisions faster.

    ### Key Features
    1. Import Your Dataset: Simply import your molecule dataset in various file formats, including SDF, SMILES, and InChi, to get started.

    2. Define Selection Criteria: Specify the desired level of diversity and other relevant parameters to tailor the subset selection to your unique requirements.

    3. Run the Analysis: Let QC-Selector‚Äôs powerful algorithms process your dataset and efficiently select the most diverse molecules.

    4. Export: Explore the diverse subset and export the results for further analysis and integration into your projects.
