class GridPartition(SelectionBase):
    r"""Select subset of sample points using the grid partitioning algorithms.

    Given the number of bins along each axis, samples are partitioned using various methods [1]_:

    - The `equisized_independent` partitions the feature space into bins of equal size along
      each dimension.

    - The `equisized_dependent` partitions the space where the bins can have different length
      in each dimension. I.e., the `l-`th dimension bins depend on the previous dimensions.
      So, the order of features affects the outcome.

    - The `equifrequent_independent` divides the space into bins with approximately equal
      number of sample points in each bin.

    - The `equifrequent_dependent` is similar to `equisized_dependent` where the partition in
      each dimension will depend on the previous dimensions.

    Points are initially used to construct a KDTree. Eucleidean distances are used for this

    find_furthest_neighbor and is selected. find_nearest_neighbor is then done to eliminate close
    neighbors to the new selected point. Medoid is then calculated from previously selected points
    and is used as the new query point for find_furthest_neighbor, repeating the process. Terminates
    upon selecting requested number of points or if all available points exhausted.
