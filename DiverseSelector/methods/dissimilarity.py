    """Selecting samples using MaxMin algorithm.

    MaxMin is possibly the most widely used method for dissimilarity-based
    compound selection. When presented with a dataset of samples, the
    initial point is chosen as the dataset's medoid center. Next, the second
    point is chosen to be that which is furthest from this initial point.
    Subsequently, all following points are selected via the following
    logic:

    1. Find the minimum distance from every point to the already-selected ones.
    2. Select the point which has the maximum distance among those calculated
       in the previous step.
