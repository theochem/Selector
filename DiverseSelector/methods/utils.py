def optimize_radius(obj, X, size, cluster_ids=None):
    """Algorithm that uses sphere exclusion for selecting points from cluster.

    Iteratively searches for the optimal radius to obtain the correct number
    of selected samples. If the radius cannot converge to return `size` points,
    the function returns the closest number of samples to `size` as possible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj: object
        Instance of `DirectedSphereExclusion` or `OptiSim` selection class.
    X: ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Feature matrix of `n_samples` samples in `n_features` dimensional space.
    size: int
        Number of sample points to select (i.e. size of the subset).
    cluster_ids: np.ndarray
        Indices of points that form a cluster.

    Returns
    -------
    selected: list
        List of indices of selected samples.
