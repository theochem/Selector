    """Selecting points using Directed Sphere Exclusion algorithm.

    Starting point is chosen as the reference point
    and not included in the selected molecules. The
    distance of each point is calculated to the reference point and the points are then sorted based
    on the ascending order of distances. The points are then evaluated in their sorted order, and
    are selected if their distance to all the other selected points is at least r away. Euclidean
    distance is used by default and the r value is automatically generated if not passed to satisfy
    the number of molecules requested.
