The `Selector` library provides methods for selecting a diverse subset of a (molecular) dataset.

## Citation

Please use the following citation in any publication using the `selector` library:

```md
@article{

}
```

## Web Server

We have a web server for the `selector` library at https://huggingface.co/spaces/QCDevs/Selector.
For small and prototype datasets, you can use the web server to select a diverse subset of your
dataset and compute the diversity metrics, where you can download the selected subset and the
computed diversity metrics.

## Installation

It is recommended to install `selector` within a virtual environment. To create a virtual
environment, we can use the `venv` module (Python 3.9+,
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), `miniconda` (https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html), or
`pipenv` (https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

### Installing from PyPI

To install `selector` with `pip`, we can install the latest stable release from the Python Package Index (PyPI) as follows:

```bash
# install the stable release
pip install qc-selector
```

### Installing from The Prebuild Wheel Files

To download the prebuilt wheel files, visit the [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/qc-selector/)
and [GitHub releases](https://github.com/theochem/Selector/tags).

```bash
# download the wheel file first to your local machine
# then install the wheel file
pip install file_path/qc_selector-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

```

### Installing from the Source Code

In addition, we can install the latest development version from the GitHub repository as follows:

```bash
# install the latest development version
pip install git+https://github.com/theochem/Selector.git
```

We can also clone the repository to access the latest development version, test it and install it as follows:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:theochem/Selector.git

# change into the working directory
cd Selector
# run the tests
python -m pytest .

# install the package
pip install .

```
